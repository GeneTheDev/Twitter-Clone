# Warbler (Twitter-Clone)

The main goal for this project is to implement a twitter like clone that allows a user to post and like another users tweet. My focus wasn't too much on the design but to demonstrate the functionality of the project.

# Project Description
Features:
- Register and login authentication
- Adding a post 
- Liking a posts
- Profile editing


Technologies used : 
- Python 
- Flask
- Postgresql (Database)

I wanted to use flask as my frame work because of the flexibility and postgres for my relational database.

# In the project directory, you can run:

Required dependencies:
- `psycopg2` (make sure you have postgres running)
- `flask` 
- or you can run `pip -r requirements.txt` to reinstall project dependencies

~$ `pip install flask psycopg2`

~$ `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

~$ `source venv/bin/activate`

To start development server:

~$ `flask run`
