# Twitter-Clone

The main goal for this project is to implement a twitter like clone that allows a user to post and like another users tweet. My focus wasn't too much on the design but to demonstrate the functionality of the project.

# Project Description

Technologies used : 
- Python 
- Flask
- Postgresql (Database)

I wanted to use flask as my frame work because of the flexibility and postgres for my relational database.

# In the project directory, you can run:

~$ python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

~$ source venv/bin/activate

~$ pip install gunicorn

To start development server: 

~$ flask run
